Puzzled

# Description: 

Welcome! Thank you for checking out my App. Puzzled is a fun, stress relievingÂ daily puzzle with local weather updates. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). HTML, CSS , and JavaScript are use to build the features, architecture, and components. Mongo Compass was used as my Database to store users ans puzzles.

In the future I would like to add a second puzzle similar to battleship. Also I would like to add relaxation tips and spotify API.

# Pre-requisites:

Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
or code editor of your choice

MongoDB Compass  https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass
or Atlas

make an account with weather api: https://www.weatherapi.com/
- accounts are free. 
- you will need your personal api key


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
